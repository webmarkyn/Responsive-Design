# Responsive-Design
BUILDING WITH RESPONSIVE DESIGN

Microverse project

In this project, we will get the chance to build a responsive website. Weâ€™ll be cloning The Next Web, a tech-focused magazine which uses media queries to gracefully degrade their site as the window size is reduced.

This project consists of building an HTML document that matches the appearance of <https://thenextweb.com/> web page.
